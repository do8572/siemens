# David Ocepek's Data Science Project Competition journal

## March 2022 (22h)

* 1. (4h): Meeting. + Initial analysis of dataset. + Discussion/organization with team.
* 2. (8h): Read reserch papers on recommender systems, followed up with tutorials and researched viable python library's. The following algorithms are supported in python MF, FM, FFM, DeepFM, RNN. Non-supported methods include HRNN-meta recommender system, graph NN also appear to be promising though will be challenging to implement.
* 3. (6h): Framework so that we don't have to reimplement common parts of our code multiple times. (Failure due to poor organization - on my part.) 
* 4. (4h): Spotlight implementation of deepFM.

## April 2022 (34h)

* 1. (12h): Analizing FuxiCTR as alternative library for deepFM. (Spotlight lacks support for categorical features.)
* 2. (10h): Analizing & building model using tensorflow deepCTR. (Enables greater control over negative sampling than FuxiCTR.)
* 3. (6h): Fixing Spotlight deepFM. (Due to some yet un-discovered bugs hit rate is 0.0 - TO BE FIXED.)
* 4. (6h): Meetings + miscelenious (journal, report, etc.)

## Total: 56h
